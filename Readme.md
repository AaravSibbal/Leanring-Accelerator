Author: Aarav Sibbal    

Use:

This program's functionality is basically to help students with 
learning on the go. This can be used my uploading either a pdf version
or a txt version of the definitions you want to learn and then through 
text to speech listening to it as you do you everyday work.

it allows you to be more productive and is espicialy useful for 
people you audio learners.

Things to be excited about:

This will have more functionality later on: 
- being able to have directory tree and hierarchy system and 
- being able to listen the text to speech through any popular person
    you like with the ability of a AI text to speech api
- there will also be a mobile version that can make the use much more
    sense to the product but this version is more of a prototype or a 
    proof of concept(it is also being used as my university assignment
    to do 2 things in one lol)
